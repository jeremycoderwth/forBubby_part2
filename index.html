                    <span>Dear Bubby,</span>
                    <p>Hi, my love. First of all, Happy 3rd Monthsary to us, parang kahapon lang ine-edit ko pa yung ini-story ko sa ig na video and may message. Now, I made this simple website to express my love and gratitude for you, I planned it matagal na and I'm so happy I made it before mag-12 AM hihi. You know how grateful I am on having you and I'm so blessed to have you in my life right now but thank you, thank you for the patience and understanding you gave to me, I'll always be thankful for all the efforts and care for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>I know you're reading it by now, I also want to say na I'm so proud of you, every step you've take is a milestone, remember always na even though every challenges you face makes you better and stronger. I see how you overcome those battles or maybe not but always remember na you're doing great and it's okay na mahirapan and you feel hopeless pero kinakaya mo and kakayanin for sure. I'm your no.1 fan and will always be. Also, thank you for making me feel safe lagi and always may nakikinig sa'kin, you're my no.1 listener.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've come along so far this way but not so far, marami pang challenges ang kahaharapin natin together but we've done better and learned from the past, we're still young but we always keep learning for ourselves. Lastly, to my beautiful baby, I love you so so much and I love you more than you could ever know. In this life, I only want you and I'll always choose you, wala ka nang magagawa kasi ako na 'to e so dapat love love mo rin ako so much hihi. Happy monthsary, my love, i love you üòòü´∂üèª
